# Part 2: Head Section
The head section contains data telling your browser more information about your page.  As we get farther into the year we'll discover more pieces of information that fit well here but tonight we'll just cover a couple.

1. Set the title for your page inside the title tags.  This sets what will show on the tab.
2. Save the file
3. In your file system, navigate to your CodingAndCocktails folder 
4. Open the _index.html_ file in your Google Chrome browser
5. You won't see anything exciting on the page itself yet but you should see your title displayed in the page tab.
