# Part 2: Head Section
The head section contains data telling your browser more information about your page.  As we get farther into the year we'll discover more pieces of information that fit well here but tonight we'll just cover a couple.

1. Change the text in between the `<title></title>` tags.  This sets what will show on the browser tab.  Tonight we'll make a Cocktail Lounge site so set the text to "YourName's Cocktail Lounge"

2. Save the file.

3. In Google Chrome, choose `Open File` from the `File` menu.  Navigate to your `CodingAndCocktails\html` folder and open the _index.html_ file.

4. You won't see anything exciting on the page yet, but you should see your title displayed in the page tab.

5. The remainder of our work will be done inside the `<body></body>` tags.  This is where any page content you can see goes.
