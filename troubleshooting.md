# Troubleshooting

###Troubleshooting Exercises

In order to continue building our coding skills, we need to practice - just like when playing sports or learning a musical instrument. Letâ€™s try some troubleshooting so you can feel more confident coding on your own!

1.  Open a new file in Atom and save it as *troubleshooting.html*

2.  Paste the following code into the file
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Coding &amp; Cocktails Troubleshooting</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/exercise1.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Exercise 1</h1>
        <h3>Figure out what is wrong with this HTML.</h3>
        
        <p>Does anyone know why there is no image displayed below this paragraph?</p>
        
        <!--Fix the following HTML to get the image to display-->
        <div<img src="http://pngimg.com/upload/snowflakes_PNG7545.png" alt="snowflake"></div>
        
        <!--The HTML table should have two colums (Sport and Equipent) with several rows of data.-->
        <h3>How does my table look?</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Winter Sport</th>
                <td>Equipment</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Skiing</td>
                <td>Skis</td>
                <td>Poles</td>
                <td>Gloves</td>
                <td>Boots</td>
                <td>Hot Chocolate</td>
                <td>Snow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Snowboarding</td>
                <td>Snowboard, boots, gloves, etc.</td>
            </tr>
            <td>Snowshoing</td>
            <td>Snowshoes</td>
            <tr>
                <td>Sledding</td>
                <td>Sled, etc.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <!-- This HTML should display an ordered list of items. -->
        <h3>Is this list formatted according to best practices?</h3>
        <p>Here is a list:</p>
        1. First item <br/>
        2. Second item <br/>
        3. Third item <br/>

        <!-- Use some of the best practices we discussed in the presentation to fix the styling issues in this section -->
        <h3>Keep an eye to the best practices in this section.</h3>
        <H3 style="color:blue; border: 2px solid navy">Yay for pretty colors!!!</H3>
        
        <P>This is another paragraph. There is a <A href="http://codingandcocktails.kcwomenintech.org/">Coding &amp; Cocktails</A> link in this paragraph. <b>I want only this sentence to be bold. Which cocktail is your favorite tonight?  What is your favorite holiday tradition?  Who likes snow & ice?  Is 3 < 5? <i>This sentence should be in italics</i></P>
        
        <!-- Winter Wonderland, is there something missing from this img tag? -->
        <img src="http://info.clearcompany.com/hs-fs/hub/212972/file-2248258334-jpg/IMG-Blog-Posts/Winter-Wonderland.jpg" />
    
      </body>
</html>
```

8.  Save the file and open it in your Google Chrome browser

9.  The first thing to fix is that our image is not displayed underneath the paragraph.  See if you can make the image show up by editing the HTML. 
> Remember to save and refresh the page in Google Chrome to see your changes

10. The second issue to fix is the table so it has two columns (Sport and Equipent) with several rows of data.

11. Next, update the list of items to use an HTML ordered list so our webpage has the correct structure

12. After that, update the HTML headers keeping an eye to our HTML best practices

13. Finally, when we talked about image tags there was an attribute we mentioned as a good idea to include on images.  Update the image tag to have this attribute.
