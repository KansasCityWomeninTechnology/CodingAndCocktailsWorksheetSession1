# Part 6: Tables

Let's add some content to the menu section!  We'll add a menu inside an HTML table. 

1. Add an HTML table under the "Menu" header. (Don't forget to use emmet to help you write your HTML faster! 
    * View the [documentation for HTML tables on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) to get your table structured. You'll find examples towards the bottom of the page.
    
    * One column should contain the `Menu Item` and the other column should contain `Price`
    
2. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

    * Your table should end up looking something like this but feel free to include your own drinks and prices!
