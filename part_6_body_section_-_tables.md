# Part 7: Tables

Add some content to the menu section using an HTML table. 

1. In Atom, add an HTML table under the "Menu" header. 
{% hint style='tip' %}Don't forget to use emmet to help you write your HTML faster!{% endhint %}

    * Check out the [MDN documentation on HTML tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) to figure out how to structure your table. There are samples near the bottom of the page.
    
    {% hint style='tip' %}The "Simple table with header" is a good example to follow.{% endhint %}
    
    {% hint style='info' %}All of the table attributes listed in the documentation are now "deprecated" - meaning they are no longer used in HTML but are handled in a different way (usually through CSS which we will cover in a future class). You can scroll past the attributes to get to the exmaples.{% endhint %}
    
    * One column should contain the **Menu Item** and the other column should contain **Price**.
    
2. Add a `class` attribute to your `table` element with a value of **"table"**.
    
3. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

    * Your table should end up looking something like this but feel free to include your own drinks and prices!
