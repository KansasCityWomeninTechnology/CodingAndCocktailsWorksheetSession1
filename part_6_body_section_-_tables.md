# Part 7: Tables

Let's add some content to the menu section!  We'll add a menu inside an HTML table. 

1. Add an HTML table under the "Menu" header. (Don't forget to use emmet to help you write your HTML faster!

    * Check out the [MDN documentation on HTML tables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table) to figure out how to structure your table, there are samples near the bottom of the page.  
    > The **Simple table with header** is a good example to follow
    
    * One column should contain the **Menu Item** and the other column should contain **Price**
    
2. Add a `class` attribute to your table element with a value of "table"
    
2. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

    * Your table should end up looking something like this but feel free to include your own drinks and prices!
