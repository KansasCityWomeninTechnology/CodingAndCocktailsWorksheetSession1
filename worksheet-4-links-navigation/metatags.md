1. Inside the `<head>` section of your file, add the following `<meta>` tags to help with SEO.
   ```html
   <meta name="author" content="">
   <meta name="description" content="">
   <meta name="keywords" content="">
   ```

1. Fill in the content section for "author" using your name.
1. Fill in the content section for "description" to describe your cocktail lounge. This is the text that Google and other search engines used for website summaries in search results.
1. Fill in the content section for "keywords" using a comma separated list of words for search engines to use, such as "Cocktails,Code".

   Your head section should look similar to this:

   {% filename %}index.html{% endfilename %}
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
       <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
       <title>Coding's Cocktail Lounge</title>
       <meta name="author" content="Coding and Cocktails">
	   <meta name="description" content="Yummy cocktails served with a side of code">
       <meta name="keywords" content="Cocktails,HTML,Code">
   </head>
   <body>
  
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
1. Save your file. You won't see any visible changes, but under the covers, your website is now more searchable.
