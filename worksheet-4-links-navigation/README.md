# Links & Navigation

Our web page is really coming together. But web pages have navigation and ways to link to other sections of the page. HTML 5 added `<nav>` and `<footer>` elements to the mix so let's practice using those. Let's work on this!

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
1. Create a navigation section for your web page
1. Create a footer for your web page
1. Add a list for navigation sections
1. Create links for each section of your web page


## Create a navigation section {#nav-section}
We'll now create a navigation row section and add a navbar.
{% include "./nav-section.md" %}

## Create a footer {#footer}
Let's create a footer row section and add a footer.
{% include "./footer.md" %}

## Add a list {#lists}
Lists often come in handy on a webpage - both ordered (numbered) lists and unordered (bulleted) lists.  Website navigation is often an unordered list of links so that's where we'll be using a list. We have three page sections - About, Menu, and Contact - so we'll need three navigation list items.
{% include "./lists.md" %}

## Create links {#links}
The navigation items should take the user to the page sections they reference. In order to do that, anchor elements need to be added to create a hyperlink to those sections of the page.
{% include "./links.md" %}
