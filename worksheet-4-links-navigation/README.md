# Links & Navigation

Our web page is really coming together. But web pages have navigation and ways to link to other sections of the page. HTML 5 added `<nav>` and `<footer>` elements to the mix so let's practice using those. Let's work on this!

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
{% include "./navigation.html" %}

## Create a navigation section {#nav-section}
We'll now create a navigation row section and add a navbar.
{% include "./nav-section.md" %}

## Create a footer {#footer}
Let's create a footer row section and add a footer.
{% include "./footer.md" %}

## Add a list {#lists}
Lists often come in handy on a webpage - both ordered (numbered) lists and unordered (bulleted) lists.  Website navigation is often an unordered list of links so that's where we'll be using a list. Using list elements is also helpful for accessibility since screenreaders utilize the metadata. We have three page sections - About, Menu, and Contact - so we'll need three navigation list items.
{% include "./lists.md" %}

## Create links {#links}
The navigation items should take the user to the page sections they reference. In order to do that, anchor elements need to be added to create a hyperlink to those sections of the page.
{% include "./links.md" %}

## Add tags to improve SEO {#seo}
Your website is almost done! Now we want to apply concepts we learned about Search Engine Optimization (SEO) to make your web page easier for search engines like Google to index.
{% include "./metatags.md" %}
