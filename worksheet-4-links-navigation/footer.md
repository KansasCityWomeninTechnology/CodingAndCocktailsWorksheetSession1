1. Add another `div.row` before the `</div>` tag that is closing the `<div class="container">` element. Use Atom to help you find the closing tags.

3. Add a `<footer>` element between the opening and closing tags of the `div.row` you created.

4. Footers often contain copyright information so try using an [HTML entity](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) to add a copyright symbol. Between the opening and closing `<footer></footer>` tags add the text 

   `&copy; Copyright Your Name 2018`.

3. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
