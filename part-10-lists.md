#Part 10: Lists

Lists often come in handy on a webpage - both ordered (numbered) lists and unordered (bulleted) lists.  Often website navigation is an unordered list of links so that's where we'll be using a list. We have three sections - About, Menu, and Contact so we'll need three navigation list items.

 1. We're again going to use the magic of emmet to make our lives easier.  Inside the `nav` tag type `ul.nav.navbar-nav>li*3` and push the `tab` key.  Voila! An unordered list with two classes and three list items ready to go!
 
 2. Inside each list item type the section names About, Menu and Contact.
 
 3. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
 
Now we can see our navigation item list on our page but they don't actually navigate anywhere so let's add that in Part 11.
