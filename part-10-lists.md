#Part 10: Lists

Lists often come in handy on a webpage - both ordered (numbered) lists and unordered (bulleted) lists.  Often website navigation is an unordered list of links so that's where we'll be using a list. We have three sections - About, Menu, and Contact so we'll need three navigation list items.

 1. We're again going to use the magic of emmet to make our lives easier.  Inside the `nav` tag type `ul>li*3` and push the `tab` key.  Voila! unordered list with three items ready to go!
 
 2. Inside each list item type the section names About, Menu and Contact.
