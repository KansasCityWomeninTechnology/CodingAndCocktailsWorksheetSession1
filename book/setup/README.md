Open [Slack](http://kcwit.slack.com/) to the **#codingandcocktails** channel. It's a great way to stay in touch with your Coding & Cocktails girlfriends and to ask questions during and after the session. We'll also post updates and tips in Slack if we run in to any stumbling blocks tonight.

If you are using a Chromebook, having trouble installing tools, or otherwise need to use a Cloud IDE option, we will use a cloud development environment called [**CodeSandbox**](https://codesandbox.io). In order to use CodeSandbox, you will need a GitHub account. 

Navigate to GitHub to create a personal account or log in. Feel free to ask your mentor for help! When complete and logged in to GitHub, return here to continue the instructions. You won't install any tools listed on this page, but please read through them so you have context for tonight's worksheet.

## Helpful tips as you work through the worksheet {#tips}

{% hint style='tip' %}
View the worksheet and your IDE in split screen. 

For Windows users, use `windows key` + `left arrow` or `windows` + `right arrow` to resize the application and position to the left or right half of your screen.

For Mac users, hold down the full-screen button in the upper-left corner of a window to shrink and position to the left or right side of the screen. Release the button, then click another window to begin using both windows side by side.

Did you know you can perform common tasks such as copy and paste and navigate VS Code using keyboard shortcuts? 

When working without a mouse, keyboard shortcuts will be faster than a trackpad. Open the [handy dandy keyboard shortcut reference in a new tab](/references/README.md) so you can refer to it easily!
