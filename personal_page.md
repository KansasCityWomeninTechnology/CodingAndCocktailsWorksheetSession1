# Personal Page

**Create Your Personal Page**

This can be either a personal professional and resume page or if you feel more comfortable creating something a bit less personalized create something about one of your hobbies or a favorite subject or movie.

1.  Create a folder/directory to house your project in the same location where you cloned the github repository to.
2.  Open the folder in Sublime Text and save a new file as index.html
3.  Set up your basic HTML page syntax and set your page title
4.  Some ideas to include in your page:
    1.  Put your name at the top in an h1 tag
    2.  Add a paragraph telling a little bit about yourself
    3.  Add a brief paragraph about where you want to go next as a professional
    4.  Add a list of your favorite links
    5.  Add your contact information, link to your linkedin profile, github repositories or twitter page.
    6.  Add a “currently” section to list what you are currently reading, learning and/or listening to
5.  Create an index.css page
6.  Link to your index.css page in your index.html page
7.  Start adding styles to your page!
8.  BONUS: Store your code on github - feel free to ask mentors for help in getting this working for you!
