# Part 9: Navigation & Footer

Most websites have a way to navigate around, let's add navigation to ours.  HTML 5 added nav and footer elements to the mix so let's practice using those!

1. Add row sections for these as well. First, create the navigation section. 
    
    1. Above the first `div.row` add a new `div.row`
    
    2. Inside that row add a `div.col-sm-12`
    
    3. Finally, add a `nav` element with the classes **navbar** and **navbar-default** inside the div from step ii.
    
    4. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

2. Next comes the footer.  

    1. Add another `div.row` just inside the closing `</body>` tag
    
    2. Inside that row add a `div.col-sm-12`
    
    3. Add a `footer` element inside that `div`

    4. Footers often contain copyright information so try using an [HTML entity](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) to add a copyright symbol. Inside the `footer` tag add the text `&copy;` and the text " Copyright your name 2016"

3. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
