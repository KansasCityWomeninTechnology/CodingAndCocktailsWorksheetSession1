# Part 9: Navigation & Footer

Most websites have a way to navigate around, let's add navigation to ours.  HTML 5 added nav and footer elements to the mix so let's give that a try!

1. We'll need to add row sections for these as well.  
    
    1. Above your first `div.row` add a new `div.row`
    
    2. Inside that row
Add a `nav` element to the top of the `<body>` section.
    
    ...Great but not exciting... Wheres the navigation bits? We'll add the navigation links in Part 11: Anchors!
    
2. Add a `footer` element just inside the closing `</body>` tag

3. Footers often contain copyright information so let's try using an [HTML entity](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp) to put our copyright symbol in. Inside your footer add `&copy;` and the text " Copyright your name 2016"

4. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
