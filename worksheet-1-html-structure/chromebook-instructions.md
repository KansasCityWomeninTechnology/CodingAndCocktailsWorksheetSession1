Tonight we will use [CodePen](https://codepen.io) as your IDE.

1. Sign up for a [free account at CodePen](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free).

1. Confirm your account from your email and log in to CodePen.

1. Select **Create** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> **New Pen** from the top toolbar.

1. Select **Settings** and type in a title for this Pen, such as "Session 1". You do not need a description but feel free to add one if you'd like. Click **Save & Close**.

1. In CodePen, we have to add items to the head section separately. Click the **Gear** icon next to "HTML" to open HTML settings. Add the `<meta>` and `<title>` tags from the _index.html_ shown in [Create HTML structure](#structure) to the "Stuff for &lt;head&gt;" textbox. Click **Save & Close**.

    {% hint style='info' %}You will need to open HTML settings to access "Stuff for &lt;head&gt;" every time the worksheet instructs you to modify the head section.
{% endhint %}

1. Follow the instructions in [HEAD step](#head) to change the title of your web page. Save your file by clicking the **Save** button in the toolbar.

1. CodePen will automatically display changes as you go tonight. If you want to view your progress in a full screen, see the title of your web page, and inspect elements in Chrome, select **Change View** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> **Full Page**. 
   
   Return to the editor by selecting **Change View** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> **Editor View**.  

1. Continue with worksheet instructions starting in [Part 2: HTML Body](../worksheet-2-body-paragraph).

{% hint style='info' %}CodePen does not have automatic inline linting like what is available in Atom. Instead, it analyzes your html when you ask it to. 

Click on the dropdown button next to "HTML" and select **Analyze HTML**. You can ignore the "The class container are used in the HTML but not found in any stylesheet" warning. Those warnings will resolve later in the worksheet.
{% endhint %}
