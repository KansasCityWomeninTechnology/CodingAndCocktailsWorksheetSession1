# Part 11: Anchors (aka Links)

We want our navigation items to actually take us to the page sections they are meant for and in order to do that we have to add anchor elements to create a hyper link to those sections of our page.

1. Select the "About" text in your first list item and use the keyboard shortcut to wrap a tag around other content. 
|Windows Key Combination|Mac Key Combination|
|---|---|
|`ctrl` + `alt` + `w`|`ctrl` + `w`|

2. Type just an `a` in the prompt that comes up and an anchor tag with it's `href` attribute will show up wrapped around your text.

3. Now we need to tell the anchor where we want it to go when we click on it.  For "About" we want it to go to our "About" section of our page.  We've identified this with the id `#about` on our about's `div` element.  Set the `href` attribute's value to "#about."

4. Repeat this process for the Menu and Contact sections as well.
