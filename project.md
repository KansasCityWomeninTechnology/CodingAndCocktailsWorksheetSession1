HTML provides your website with the underlying structure.  We'll start with a basic HTML structure and continue with adding page content.

## Part 1
1. Create a new file and save it as index.html
2. Open this file in atom and type `html` and press the `tab` button on your keyboard.  This should come out looking like the following: 
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
</html>```
