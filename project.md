# Project

HTML provides your website with the underlying structure.  We'll start with a basic HTML structure and continue with adding page content.

## Part 1: HTML Page Structure
We'll explore using the Emmet plugin in the Atom text editor that we use as our development environment.  This plugin helps us write our code faster and more efficiently.
1. Open Atom
2. Go to the file menu and choose `New File`
3. Go to the file menu and choose `Save As...`
4. Name the file _index.html_ and save it in your `CodingAndCocktails` folder
5. In your _index.html_ file type `html` and press the `tab` button on your keyboard.  This should come out looking like the following: 
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
    
    </body>
</html>
```
6. Cheers! You just set up the structural foundation of a web page!
