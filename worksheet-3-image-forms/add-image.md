1. In Atom, add an `<img>` tag below the "**About**" header on your page.  
{% hint style='tip' %}Use Emmet to complete your tag for you - it will automatically add your `src` and `alt` attributes for you but you still have to fill out their content!  The `src` attribute tells your code where to look for your image and the `alt` attribute content gets displayed if your image is not able to render and is used by screen readers for better accessibility. {% endhint %}

1. For your `src` attribute you'll need to point to where the file is.  Since we placed our image in the same folder we only need to provide the file name you chose in step 4 (including the file extension!) inside the quotation marks here.

1. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
