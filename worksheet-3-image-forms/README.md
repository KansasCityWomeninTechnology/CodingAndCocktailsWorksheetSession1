# Images & Forms

They say a picture is worth 1000 words. And you can't have a cocktail website without knowing who your customers are. Let's add some visual appeal by using images and provide a way for our fans to contact us.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
{% include "./navigation.html" %}

## Download image {#download-image}
Let's find and prepare a cocktail image that appeals to you.
{% include "./download-image.md" %}

## Add images {#add-image}
Add an image to bring some interest to your page.
{% include "./add-image.md" %}

## Create form groups {#forms}
You now need a form to allow users to contact you. Forms typically require a bit of JavaScript but that tool is not in our toolbelt just yet so we'll use a tool called Formspree. You can read up on it at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io/).
{% include "./form.md" %}

## Add text form input {#form-text}
The first section is the name section. 
{% include "./form-text.md" %}

## Add email form input {#form-email}
The second section will be for the user email address.
{% include "./form-email.md" %}

## Add textarea form input {#form-textarea}
Now we'll create the area for the message.
{% include "./form-textarea.md" %}

## Add submit button {#form-submit}
Lastly, we need a way to submit the form. 
{% include "./form-submit.md" %}
