CodePen does not support uploading images so we have to link directly to the file on the web. Use the following instructions to add a preselected image to your webpage.

1. Add an `<img>` tag by following step 1 of [Add images](#add-image). Return to special instructions when you've created the `<img>` tag.

1. For your `src` attribute, you will point to a pre-selected image. Use the following link inside the quotation marks `https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4148/4997067533_91d1c9d281_z.jpg`.

   {% hint style='tip' %}Ask a mentor for help you want a different cocktail image.
{% endhint %}

1. Continue the worksheet starting from [Create form groups](#forms).
