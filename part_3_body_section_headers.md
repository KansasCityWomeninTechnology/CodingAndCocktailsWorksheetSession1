# Part 3: Headers & Page Sections

The body section of your HTML contains the visible part of your webpage.  Let's start building out some content!

1. We'll create sections within our page with `div` tags.  

    1. In Atom, between the opening and closing `<body></body>` tags, type `div.container` and press the `tab` key.  This will create a `div` element with a class attribute with the value of container and will be the main container element for our page.
    
    {% hint style='tip' %}
    Anytime you want to add a `class` attribute to an element you can add that by adding a period and then the classname you want to add when you're using emmet to create your elements. {% endhint %}

    {% hint style='tip' %}
    An `id` attribute can be added by typing a `#` and then the name of the id you'd like to set.
    {% endhint %}

    {% hint style='info' %}

    {% endhint %}
            
    Your body section should now look like this: 
    
    ![](/assets/firstTag.png)

    2. Nested inside the `div.container` create another `div` element with the class `row`. Type `div.row` and press the `tab` key. _Don't forget to indent so your code is easy to read!_
    Your body section should now look like this: 
    
    ![](/assets/secondTag.png)
    
    {% hint style='info' %}
    Classes are often used to apply styling to elements - we will learn about styling next month. We'll see this in action later in the worksheet.  For now, don't worry too much about what the classes mean - we're focusing on the HTML this month.
    {% endhint %}
    
    4. Save the page, switch over to Google Chrome and reload.  Even though we've started adding content to the `body` section there is still nothing to see.

2. Create an `h1` tag inside the last `div` element. Type `h1` then press the `tab` key. Write the name of your cocktail lounge between the opening and closing tags.

4. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome. **We have content!**

4. After the closing `h1` tag, add an `h2` tag for a subtitle containing the text "Cocktails with a side of code." 
    It should look something like this: 
    
    ![](/assets/thirdCheckpoint.png)

5. Next, we'll want an "About" section, a "Menu" section, and a "Contact" section using more `div` tags. We'll need to add `id` attributes to these `divs` for navigation later in the worksheet.
    
    1. Inside the `div.container` element but below closing `</div>` tag for the first `div.row` element, type `div.row#about` and press the `tab` key.  This will be the area for our "About" section. The element you created should look like this:
    ![](/assets/div.png)
    
    {% hint style='tip' %}If you place your cursor on any HTML element, Atom will underline the matching opening or closing tag for you. {% endhint %}
    
    3. Inside that about `div`, we'll title the section.  Since this is the third most important heading on the page we'll use an `h3` tag. Place the text "About" between the tags.
    
6. Repeat this process twice more for the Menu and Contact sections.

    1. In between the opening and closing tags for the `div.container` element but below the closing `</div>` tag for the about section, type `div.row#menu` and press the `tab` key. This will be the area for our "Menu" section.

    3. Inside the menu `div`, title the section with the text "Menu" using an `h3` tag.
    
    4. In between the opening and closing tags for the `div.container`, below the menu section, add a row with the id of "contact." 

    6. Create an `h3` tag with the text "Contact" between the opening and closing div tags created in the last step.

7. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome. Your page should look similar to this:
