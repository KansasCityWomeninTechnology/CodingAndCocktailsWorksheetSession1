# Part 3: Body Section - Headers

The body section of your HTML contains the visible part of your webpage.  Let's start building out some content!

1. Add the main header of your page using an `h1` tag inside the `body` section.  Don't forget to write the text you want displayed between the opening and closing tags!
2. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
3. Tada! We have content! 

4. Next, Lets add a subtitle.  What tag do you think we might use here? 

5. Finally, we'll add two different sections.  We'll want to use an `h3` tag here since this is the third most important heading on the page.
