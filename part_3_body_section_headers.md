# Part 3: Headers & Page Sections

The body section of your HTML contains the visible part of your webpage.  Let's start building out some content!

1. Typically our pages will have different sections and we'll create these with `div` tags.  Let's make our main page section and a section for our page header.

    1. Inside the `body` tag type `div.container` and press the `tab` button.  This will be the main container for our page 


Use emmet to add the main header of your page using an `h1` tag inside the `body` section. just type `h1` then press the `tab` key. Don't forget to write the text you want displayed between the opening and closing tags!  Write out the name of your cocktail lounge here.

2. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

    **Tada! We have content!**

3. Next, Lets add a subtitle.  What tag do you think we might use here? 
>Hint: This is probably the second most important header content on our page. For our cocktail lounge we might use the text "Cocktails with a side of code." 

4. Finally, we'll add three different sections. We'll want an "About" section a "Menu" section and a "Contact" section.  To section out parts of our page we typically use the `div` tag.
    * We want to add `id` attributes to these sections for navigation later. Under therite `div#about` t
    
    * We'll want to use an `h3` tag here since this is the third most important heading on the page.  

5. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
