# Part 3: Body Section - Headers

The body section of your HTML contains the visible part of your webpage.  Let's start building out some content!

1. Use emmet to add the main header of your page using an `h1` tag inside the `body` section. just type `h1` then press the `tab` key. Don't forget to write the text you want displayed between the opening and closing tags!  If you're choosing to build our cocktail lounge you'll want to write out the name of your cocktail lounge here.

2. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

3. Tada! We have content!

4. Next, Lets add a subtitle.  What tag do you think we might use here? Hint: This is probably the second most important header content on our page. For our cocktail lounge we might use the text "Cocktails with a side of code." 

5. Finally, we'll add three different sections.  We'll want to use an `h3` tag here since this is the third most important heading on the page.  We'll want an "About" section a "Menu" section and a "Contact" section.

6. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.
