# HTML Element Attributes {#top}

Our web page is coming together. But web pages have images, input, and links. All these HTML elements use **attributes** for extra metadata it needs to work. 

There's also special tags we can add to make our webpage more searchable by search engines like Google. This practice is called **S**earch **E**ngine **O**ptimization. These tags rely on attributes.

We'll add an image, text input field, links, and to practice using attributes.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:
{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Find and download a fun and exciting image {#download-image} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Websites have eye catching images. Let's find one we like and get it ready to add to our site!
{% include "./1download-image.md" %}

## Add an image {#image} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Now it's time to add the image to our website. We get to use our first attributes to provide the info the browser needs to display the image.
{% include "./2image.md" %}

## Set up an text input element {#input} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Some websites have the ability to subscribe to a mailing list. We won't set up the HTML form elements necessary to make it work, but we can practice learning about HTML elements and attributes by setting up a text input element.
{% include "./3input.md" %}

## Use `anchor` elements for navigation {#link} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
A navbar isn't helpful if it doesn't navigate to the different sections of the webpage. In this section we'll add `anchor` elements to the list of sections in the navbar and make it link their respective section in the webpage. The linked section also needs an attribute for hyperlinks to work.
{% include "./4link.md" %}

## Add tags to improve SEO {#seo} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Your website is almost done! Now we want to apply concepts we learned about **S**earch **E**ngine **O**ptimization (SEO) to make your web page easier for search engines like Google to index.
{% include "./5metatags.md" %}

You did it! You created a website!
