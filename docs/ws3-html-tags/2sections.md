1. After the `<h2></h2>` subtitle, press `Enter` to start a new line. Add a "About" section by typing `<section></section>`.
   {% hint style="info" %}
There's a lot of different HTML elements. When writing HTML, focus on the content and the meaning of what you are trying to communicate, not the website presentation. Good web development practice recommends doing so and calls this style of coding **Semantic HTML**.

Sections group standalone content and typically include a header. Read more about `<section>`, `<div>`, and container HTML elements in the references. 
   {% endhint %}

1. Between the opening and closing tags for `<section>`, let's add the "About" header. Since this is the third most important heading on the page, we'll use an `<h3>` tag.
   {% hint style="working" %}
<details>
<summary>

Place your cursor between the opening and closing tags for <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, press <code>Enter</code>, and type <code>&lt;h3&gt;About&lt;/h3&gt;</code>. Your code should look like this
<pre>
<code class="lang-html">
&lt;section&gt;
   &lt;h3&gt;About&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code>
</pre>
</details>
   {% endhint %}

1. After the "About" header, but still inside the `<section>` element, we should add a description about this fine establishment. Add a paragraph element and type in a description of your choosing. The paragraph element is `<p>`. 
   {% hint style="tip" %}
Don't forget to close the `<p>` tag.
   {% endhint %}

&lt;/section&gt;
&lt;section&gt;
&lt;/section&gt;
</code>
</pre>
</details>
   {% endhint %}

1. The "Contact" section needs a header and a description, just like the "About" section. Let's start with the header. Add the header and use the text "Contact".

1. Then add a description for the "Contact" section using the text 
   "Stay in contact with us by adding your email address to our mailing list."
