# Front-End Architecture and HTML {#top}
Tonight we cover front-end architecture and HTML basics. 

Front-end architecture is the organization of code and project files. Though there can be customizations specific to a team, the goal of good front-end architecture is to provide an efficient workflow that is maintainable throughout the project’s life.

HTML is one of the building blocks of a web page. It defines the structure of the page and lays the foundation to then add styles and dynamic content. 

We’ll put both concepts to use here creating our own web page and begin understanding how to organize your code, HTML structure, as well as becoming more comfortable using an **I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**ditor (**IDE**) to write HTML.

# Organizing Assets
Organizing files with similar purposes makes creating and maintaining web applications easier. In this section we will manually organize files for a website.
In this session, we will become familiar with best practices for front-end architecture by organizing assets in a way that will make it easy to maintain the website.

This section will help guide you through the following steps:

{% include "./instruction-steps.html" %}

## Create application folder and download assets {#assets} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Let's get the files we need so we can practice website asset organization.
{% include "./1download.md" %}

## Group like files into appropriate directories {#organize} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Now we need to group like files so that the website assets are well organized.
{% include "./2organize.md" %}

## Update references in the HTML file {#references} <span class="navigate-top"><a href="#top" title="Take me to the top of page"><i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-up" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></span>
Lastly, we need to update references to the assets in _index.html_ so that our website displays properly by replacing the string `DIR` with the correct path name.
{% include "./3references.md" %}
