   {% hint style='info' %}
The directory name **js** is interchangeable with the directory name **scripts**. Using "scripts" or "js" as the directory name is personal preference.
   {% endhint %}

1. Open the _index.html_ file in Google Chrome to preview your site. Oh no! Looks like the site is broken. We’re missing the styling and some images specifically. Our HTML page doesn’t know how we’ve organized our project so we’ll need to tell it where to find the files it needs.
