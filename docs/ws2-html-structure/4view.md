1. Now we want to preview the _index.html_ file in Chrome. Instead of saving and reloading the page like we did earlier, we'll use the atom plugin **atom-live-server**. This package opens up the web page in your default web browser and reloads the page whenever you save files. In Atom, start the live server by selecting **Packages** <i class="fa fa-long-arrow-right"></i> **atom-live-server**. Select **Start server**. A browser tab will open.
   {% hint style='danger' %}
If you don't have the **atom-live-server** package, take a moment to [set up your workspace](/setup).
   {% endhint %}   

   {% hint style='danger' %}
If the tab opens in another browser, copy the URL and paste it into a new tab in Chrome. The reload will automatically happen in Chrome.

If you get an access warning, click "Allow" to let **atom-live-server** serve the application.
   {% endhint %}   

1. You won't see anything exciting on the page yet, but you should see your title displayed in the page tab.
