1. In Atom, use the magic of Emmet to make your life easier.  Between the opening and closing `<nav>` tags, type the Emmet command `ul.nav.navbar-nav>li*3` and press the `Tab` key.  Voila! An unordered list with two classes and three list items ready to go!

   {% hint style='info' %}You told Emmet that you wanted an unordered list (`ul`) with a `.nav` class and a `.navbar-nav` class with child (`>`) list item elements (`li`), three of them (`*3`) {% endhint %}

2. Between each list item's opening and closing tags type the section names **About**, **Menu** and **Contact**.

3. Save your file and reload it in Google Chrome.

Navigation items display on the page but don't yet navigate anywhere - we'll add that in next.
